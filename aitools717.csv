Usually I keep this to math homework, basically using it as a calculator with extra steps. I do believe it impacts my learning as it prevents me from struggling, which is a necessary component to understanding material fully.","I believe with the usage of AI increasing, there should be more physical inperson engagement when it comes to learning, or engagement towards using more real world examples for solving problems. AI tends to be really bad at intepretting scenario based problems when it comes to math or CS, so I think making problems about real world scenarios would benefit students a lot as it makes them more engaged into the material, having them actually have to read what the problem is saying and fully understand what is going on. I also think for STEM majors there should be more project based learning, which necessitates self expression. ","Students should use AI only when they already understand the material. Its okay to use it to take out all the busy work from your workload, but you have to actually understand what its doing. its like if taking out the trash was automated, itd be nice to have a machine do it for you, but you should understand why the machine throws glass in the recycling bin and not the trash bin."

Beyond that level, at least in problem-solving areas of STEM, it is less concerning. AI cannot handle those tasks.","I think AI might be more concerning for students who graduate.

Thus the line becomes rather grey on what I should count as AI use. Furthermore, I feel rather discouraged from competing with other students in class or aspiring for better grades, as I am under the assumption that a large portion of my classmates are using AI tools to maximize their scores on homework and take-home assignments. I am a slow learner, so my grades in homeworks and quizzes have always been on the mediocre side and I am used to this to where I am not too bothered, but it is something I keep in mind.",Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,"I am a bit stubborn and do genuinely enjoy learning, so I always give an honest effort into my assignments and coursework first. However, I have noticed that my grades, which have remained relatively stable, are trending lower and lower in terms of percentile on quiz and homework curves.

Unfortunately, most of the interactions I have with other AI tools have been negative. Google Gemini is bad for the environment, often produces incorrect results, and is unable to be turned off. DALL-E, Midjourney, and all other AI Image generators steal the intellectual property of artists, which makes it particularly difficult to be an art major. ",Somewhat Agree,Somewhat Agree,"Because these AI tools exist, sometimes I'm tempted to use it on assignments when I'm overwhelmed with school, work, and caregiving responsibilities, but this really only applies to having it point out spelling mistakes before I turn in assignments. Ultimately, I end up spellchecking the assignments, myself. 

Other than that, I'd be too scared of plagiarism to let AI generate anything school related for me.  ","Not much, but I'd like laws and ethics to catch up to AI companies, and I do not want to see AI art generation used educationally at this university, because the AI has been trained with the IP of artists who did not consent to their works being stolen. ","I think AI can be used wisely, but the way many students are using it is irresponsible. Sometimes students AI generate certain things because they genuinely don't have time to complete assignments, and it's not like they can lessen their course load. Many students such as I cannot spend more years at this university due to the cost, and have to take as many credits as possible in order to stay on track. This leads to students feeling like they are underwater when their professors give them too much work, hence why they use AI. 

I believe that if we create a more equitable university system in regards to how much this school costs, and the 4 year plan, we would not have as many students use AI in academically dishonest ways.

Additionally, sometimes AI is used as a crutch for critical knowledge students are not competent in. Perhaps if we created a way for students lacking essential knowledge is math, science, etc. to catch up and not feel ashamed, we would have less AI use. "

Academically, I would say there was concern, but the fact is URI was strictly against AI in the beginning. Now only 2 years later it is specifically stated what is and isn’t allowed in terms of AI. Two of my spring ‘25 teachers had syllabi and assignments co-written or completely generated by AI. So to that end, if teachers are allowed to use it to structure an assignment, there is absolutely no reason I shouldn’t be able to use the same service to complete said assignment. 

Personally, though, AI is the best thing that has come out of recent technology development. There are fields where it could NEVER replicate human performance, like medicine and sports, but when you look at it from the top down there isn’t really a difference in using it to summarize your notes versus doing it yourself, except the time it saves.

When I was in middle school, they told us we “wouldn’t be walking around with a calculator in our pockets”, and that was untrue to a comical level. The simple fact is access to information is easier and faster than ever. The resistance to this is the equivalent of that calculator statement - it sounds ridiculous because it is.

",Yes,"Benefits: A new way of studying that is personalized to me. Also very helpful for making outlines for papers. 

Challenges: Not always accurate in terms of languages or other information and content. ",Somewhat Agree,Neutral,A little. I didn't use it for the longest time because I think its a slippery slope. I have never used it to blatantly write or do an assignment for me because I am way too afraid of the consequences. Its not worth it. I did find myself relying on it more than usual to help me brainstorm this last semester. Since then I have tried to use it less and less.,"I think more research has to be done on the implications of using AI in an academic setting. In some cases there is such a gray area in terms of using it as a tool or using it to cheat. There needs to be clear rules and boundaries when using AI and I think right now, it is hard to tell how much a student used it (unless they copy and pasted). I also think AI detectors need to be made more accurate. I have put in a sample of my 100% original writing into an AI detector and it came back like 40% AI. This is not fair to students who are using original work! ","I think it can be both very useful and very harmful and until we figure out a line between the two, I do not think it should be implemented into our curriculum.    "

I've worked with other students that clearly use AI to do all their work, and they aren't capable of doing any work on their own.
